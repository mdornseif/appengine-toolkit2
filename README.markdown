# appengine-toolkit2

`gaetk2` is a modern approach to developing Python Code on Google App Engine. It is a reimplementation of [appengine-toolkit](https://github.com/mdornseif/appengine-toolkit). `appengine-toolkit` was a transfer of the techniques we used before in Django to the Google App Engine Plattform. It was different time when it was developed - back when XML was still cool and REST was all the rage.

It most noteworthly contribution of gaetk was that it integrated seamless authentication with GoogleInfrastructure - OpenID for Google Apps / Google Suite and Gmail.
