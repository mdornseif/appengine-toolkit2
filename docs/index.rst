GAETK2 - Google App Engine Toolkit 2
====================================

`gaetk2` is a modern approach to developing Python Code on Google App Engine. It is a reimplementation of `appengine-toolkit <https://github.com/mdornseif/appengine-toolkit)`. `appengine-toolkit` was a transfer of the techniques we used before in Django to the early Google App Engine Plattform. It was different time when it was developed - back then XML was still cool and REST was all the rage and App Engine was nearly feature free. Even `webapp2 <https://webapp2.readthedocs.io/>`_ had not been developed.

`gaetk2` is used in some big internal projects and tries to cover most of
what an Web Application might need.
